The project focuses on analyzing pop culture over decades and understanding if we have become more accepting of explicit content in the media we consume. We aim to analyze two main mediums: Music and Movies.

We are going to test the following hypothesis:
1) Movie ratings have become less stringent about explicit (nudity, violence, language) content in movies.
2) Music culture has become increasingly obscene over time.
        <ul>
        <li> Music lyrics contain a lot more profanity in recent years.
        <li> Songs genres with more explicit content have seen an increase in popularity over the recent years.
        </ul>
The MPAA rates every movie on a discrete scale (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17). We want to see if over the years these ratings have become less stringent.
That is, does a modern movie contain more explicit content as compared to a similarly rated movie from the past.
To do this, we will scrape the data from Kids-In-Mind website which rates the movies on three metrics (Language, Sex & Nudity, Violence & Gore). 
We will use this comprehensive rating to compare with the MPAA ratings over time.

To test the second hypothesis, we will be using the Top 100 Billboard songs data from each year and another dataset that contains songsâ€™ metadata such as lyrics, genre.
